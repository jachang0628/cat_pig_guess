## About
Ever since when I was a kid, I love drawing cats and pigs on my notebook when I was dazing off. During break time, I would often draw cats and pigs on the whiteboard for everyone to witness my awesome art skill. It has become a point that my classmates and teachers would instantly recongnize my drawing based on how these animals were drawn. They essentially became my signature and I am totally happy for that.

My obsession of drawing cats and pigs is what motivates me to do this fun project. As a data scientist, I want to create a fun app that will allow the users to sketch either a cat or a pig and the app will determine which animal the sketch is. In the future, I want to incorporate more animals into the app so that the users will not be restricted to drawing cat and pig only and they can draw other animals and the app will be able to return the appropriate results.

## Description
This APP will have a whiteboard that will allow the user to sketch an animal. When the user completes the sketch, simply pressing the upload button will allow the APP to determine the type of animal from the sketch.

The underlying model that will determine the type of animal from the sketch will be a neural network developed using PyTorch. The network will be trained using hundreds of sketches of cats and pigs downloaded from Google.
